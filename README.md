## BestBuyer

### Scans a bestbuy search page and sends email notifications if a product comes into stock

By default, the code is catered for tracking updates on https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?st=pokemon+tcg but
with a bit of modification, it can be utilized for other searches and scenarios.

This code can safely run on a spare computer/laptop or on your main computer if you keep it on 24/7. In my case, I've
left this run on a laptop I no longer use.

**Background**: I originally wrote this code so my brother and I can have a chance at any Pokemon TCG products since the
month-long dominance of scalpers in the market has made it impossible to compete. This code was our edge. After reading
posts on r/PKMNTCGDeals, I've decided to democratize this code so to share that edge with the people on reddit who
haven't had the greatest of luck.

Note: This code's only purpose is to send out website change emails, not to try to auto-buy any products.
